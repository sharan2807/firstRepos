By light cardio, I mean an easy-to-moderate intensity form of cardio exercise that raises your heart rate and warms up your body. Some examples include jogging in place, jumping jacks, or cycling on a stationary bike.

Dynamic stretching involves movements that actively take your body through a full range of motion, and it's usually done before a workout to prepare the muscles and joints for exercise. Examples of dynamic stretches include walking lunges, leg swings, arm circles, and high knees.

The combination of light cardio and dynamic stretching helps increase blood flow to your muscles, improve your flexibility and mobility, and reduce the risk of injury during your workout.
